# VRInteractionToolkit

Project Scope

To implement (and re-implement) the specified virtual reality user interaction techniques by the client as an open-source alternative to make them more accessible to the community. These techniques will be created as individual prefabs within the Unity video game engine so that they can be dropped onto an existing project to be utilized easily by anyone. They must be cross-platform and work with any primarily the HTC Vive and Oculus VR hardware that utilizes VR goggles, motion controllers, and tracking sensors. The techniques must be highly customizable while still easy to use. 
The end product will contain all of these techniques with the ability to be imported individually to unity as well as a ‘Test environment’ which would allow the user to enter an in-game space where they can select different techniques and try them out all at once. This product will be uploaded publicly to github (with concise descriptions and tutorials on how the interaction techniques work) as well as the unity asset store for anybody to use. 
As a bonus If the above has been completed within the time constraints with excess time to spare spatial movement techniques will be researched and implemented within the test environment.
